# Kubernetes Cluster with GitOps, Istio, and Monitoring Tools

This project demonstrates the deployment and management of a microservices-based application on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The solution integrates GitOps principles using ArgoCD, Istio as a service mesh for traffic management, and monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Kiali.

## Key Features

1. **Microservices Architecture**:  
   - Built a scalable application with multiple services in Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js.  
   - Ensured modularity and independent deployments for each service.

2. **GitOps Workflow**:  
   - Automated continuous deployment with ArgoCD, ensuring cluster state matches the GitHub repository.  
   - Simplified application updates through GitOps principles.

3. **Istio Service Mesh**:  
   - Enabled traffic management, security, and canary deployments.  
   - Used Istio Gateway for external traffic routing and traffic shifting for seamless updates.

4. **Monitoring and Observability**:  
   - Integrated Prometheus for metrics collection and Grafana for visualization.  
   - Used Kiali to monitor service interactions and traffic flow in the Istio service mesh.

5. **Code Quality Assurance**:  
   - Incorporated SonarQube for static code analysis to ensure high-quality code before deployments.

## Technology Stack

- **Cloud & Orchestration**: AWS EKS, Kubernetes, eksctl, kubectl  
- **GitOps**: GitHub, ArgoCD  
- **Service Mesh**: Istio  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Kiali  
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube  
- **Languages**: Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js  

## Workflow Overview

1. Developers push updated code to GitHub.
2. ArgoCD automatically redeploys changes to the Kubernetes cluster.
3. Istio handles traffic management and canary deployments.
4. Prometheus and Grafana provide performance metrics and insights.
5. SonarQube ensures code adheres to quality standards before deployments.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI  
- eksctl  
- kubectl  
- ArgoCD CLI  
- istioctl  
- Git  

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Create EKS Cluster**  
   Use `eksctl` to create an EKS cluster and configure it with `kubectl`.  

2. **Set Up ArgoCD**  
   - Install ArgoCD in the cluster.  
   - Authenticate and configure the ArgoCD server to connect to the GitHub repository.

3. **Deploy Application**  
   - Push microservices YAML files to the GitHub repository.  
   - Verify pods and access the application using `kubectl` port forwarding.

4. **Install and Configure Istio**  
   - Deploy Istio using `istioctl`.  
   - Label namespaces for Istio injection and configure traffic routing.

5. **Monitor and Analyze**  
   - Deploy Prometheus, Grafana, and Kiali add-ons.  
   - Visualize metrics and monitor traffic flow using dashboards.

6. **Code Quality**  
   - Integrate SonarQube to perform static analysis and detect vulnerabilities.

## Future Enhancements

- Automate CI pipeline for build and testing.
- Add end-to-end testing for improved reliability.
- Expand monitoring capabilities with Jaeger for tracing.

## Project Outcomes

This project demonstrates an end-to-end DevOps workflow combining Kubernetes, GitOps, service mesh, and monitoring tools. It ensures efficient deployments, robust traffic management, and continuous observability for a scalable microservices-based application.
